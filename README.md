- useForm to set and submit data
- $wrap = false in Resources
- PrepareForValidation and PassedValidation funcs in Request Validation

- Batch Insert (Unlike create() or save(), insert() does not fire model events (creating, created) and does not auto-manage timestamps unless you add them manually.)
